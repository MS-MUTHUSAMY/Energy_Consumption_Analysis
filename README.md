# Energy Consumption Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze energy usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Ontario's Broader Public Sector (BPS) organizations using a comprehensive database spanning from 2012 to 2021. By examining trends, assessing conservation effectiveness, and identifying areas for improvement, the goal is to inform data-driven strategies for achieving climate change mitigation goals within the BPS.

## Technologies Used
* Data Cleansing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Visualization (Power BI)
  
## Domain
Energy and Sustainability

## Problem Statement
The project will analyze the energy usage and GHG emissions of BPS organizations in Ontario, focusing on public hospitals and school boards. The aim is to:

* Identify trends in energy consumption and GHG emissions.
* Assess the effectiveness of conservation efforts.
* Pinpoint areas for improvement to achieve climate change mitigation goals.
* 
## Data Understanding
The dataset contains information on BPS organizations, including public hospitals and school boards. Key attributes include:

* #Sector:# Represents the organization's sector (e.g., Public Hospital, School Board).
* SubSector: Provides further classification within the sector.
* Organization: Name of the BPS organization.
* Operation: Specific operation or facility within the organization.
* Address, City, Postal Code: Location details of the organization.
* Energy Usage: Information about electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, propane, coal, wood, district heating, and district cooling consumption.
* GHG Emissions: Greenhouse gas emissions in kilograms.


Data Preparation and Cleansing
Clean and transform the data by handling missing values, standardizing units, and deriving relevant features.
Segment the data by factors such as sector, organization type, and facility size.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Power BI
Employ statistical analysis and visualization techniques to uncover key trends, patterns, and relationships.
Investigate correlations between energy consumption, GHG emissions, and factors like building size, operational hours, and weather data.
Identify outliers and areas for further investigation.
Develop compelling and interactive visualizations using Power BI to communicate insights.
Create dashboards showcasing energy consumption and GHG emissions by sector, organization, and facility type.
Design comparative visualizations to analyze performance trends and benchmark organizations against established metrics.
